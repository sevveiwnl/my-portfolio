# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences. It is built using React and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction and quick overview of what I do.
- **About Page**: More detailed information about my background and skills.
- **Projects Page**: Portfolio of my projects with descriptions and links to live sites or code repositories.
- **Contact Page**: How to reach me via email, LinkedIn, or other platforms.

## Running the Project Locally

To get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sevveiwnl/my-portfolio.git
   cd my-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command builds the app to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Deployment

You can deploy the built site using various hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. For more information on deployment, see the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.
